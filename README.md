# About

Hi there, I'm Sophia! I am a current postgraduate student at the University of Edinburgh, and future data analyst. I am continually working to improve my technical skills through courses and personal projects.

This repository serves as a showcase of my skills, a platform to share my projects, and a way to track my progress in Data Analytics and Data Science-related topics.
