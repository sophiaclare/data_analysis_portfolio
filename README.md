# Sophia Jenkinson - Data Analysis Portfolio ðŸ“š

# About

Hi there, I'm Sophia! I am a current postgraduate student at the University of Edinburgh, as well as a professional data analyst. I am continually working to improve my technical skills through courses and personal projects.

This repository serves as a showcase of my skills, a platform to share my projects, and a way to track my progress in Data Analytics and Data Science-related topics.

# Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

## R 

### [New Zealand Citizenship by Country of Birth](https://github.com/sophiaclare/R-Projects/blob/main/NZ%20Citizenship%20Project.nb.pdf)

**Description:** This project analyzes data on citizenship granted in New Zealand from 1949 to 2019, obtained from the Department of Internal Affairs.  The aim of the project is to identify the top five countries where people who earned New Zealand citizenship were born, and to analyze the trends in the number of citizenships granted to these countries over time.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization.

**Technology:** R, Tidyverse, ggplot2, dplyr, scales

**Results:** The analysis identified the top five countries where migrants to New Zealand were born, which were England, India, South Africa, China, and Fiji. The analysis also revealed trends in the number of citizenships granted to these countries over time, indicating an increase in the number of citizenships granted to migrants from India and Fiji in recent years. The project's data cleaning, analysis, and visualization techniques provide valuable insights into the migration patterns of New Zealand over the last 70 years.

## Python

### [CFG Python Project - Sales Analysis](https://github.com/sophiaclare/python-projects/blob/main/README.md)

**Description:** This project reads monthly sales data from a CSV file and performs various calculations on the data to provide insights into the sales performance. The code calculates the total sales across all months, the average sales, the month with the highest sales, the month with the lowest sales, and the monthly changes as a percentage. It then creates a bar chart of the sales by month to visually represent the data.

**Skills:** Data reading and manipulation, data analysis, statistical analysis, rounding and formatting output, data visualization.

**Technology:** Python, CSV file format, Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy.

**Results:** The code provides valuable insights into the sales performance, allowing stakeholders to make informed decisions based on the data. It calculates the total sales, average sales, and identifies the months with the highest and lowest sales. Additionally, it provides the monthly changes as a percentage, which can be used to identify trends and patterns in the sales data. The bar chart created provides a clear visual representation of the sales by month, making it easy to understand and interpret. The output is rounded and formatted in a clear and concise manner, further enhancing its readability.

## Tableau 

### [Penn State DataFest 2021](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17d4qNMA1fWdwak2E3hV8WgiuTk2t6Yia/view?usp=sharing)

**Description:** Entry for a competition held at Penn State in 2021, where each group is given a task and a data set to work with. My group recieved data on the Opiod Epidemic in Germany, and were required to create data visualizations and a predictive model for risk levels.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization, statistical modelling

**Technology:** Tableau, R

**Results:** Constructing a Risk Profile for Drug Abuse in Germany

## MCM/ICM Mathematical Modelling Competition

### [Modelling the Spread of Vespa Mandarinia in Washington State](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HdtqhLlWoN8vA84FmMvP5cbHdl562g3R/view?usp=sharing)

**Description:** Completed as an entry for the 2021 Mathematical Modelling Competition, this project proposes a model that prioritizes resources to sites of new encounters with the Asian Giant Hornet using environmental variables as predictors of spread and colonization. The model utilizes GIS mapping systems and existing monitoring infrastructure to identify potential spread outward and determine areas most likely to host the hornets in the future, enabling local authorities to act quickly to quell the invasion before the hornets become established.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization, statistical modelling

**Technology:** Tableau, R
