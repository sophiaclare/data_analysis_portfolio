# Sophia Jenkinson - Data Analysis Portfolio ðŸ“š

# About

Hi there, I'm Sophia! I am a current postgraduate student at the University of Edinburgh, and future data analyst. I am continually working to improve my technical skills through courses and personal projects.

This repository serves as a showcase of my skills, a platform to share my projects, and a way to track my progress in Data Analytics and Data Science-related topics.

# Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

## R 

### [New Zealand Citizenship by Country of Birth](https://sophiaclare.github.io/R-Projects/)

**Description:** This dataset shows the migration to and from New Zealand by country and citizenship from 1979 to 2016. Curated data by figure.nz, original data from Stats NZ. Dataset licensed under Creative Commons 4.0 - CC BY 4.0. The project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing, filling missing values, EDA (exploratory data analysis), analyzing region based user profiles.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization.

**Technology:** R, Tidyverse, ggplot2, dplyr, scales

**Results:** Review of the top countries that migrants to New Zealand were born in. 

## Python

### [CFG Python Project - Sales Analysis](https://github.com/sophiaclare/python-projects/blob/main/CFG-Sales-Analysis.py)

**Description:** This project was completed as the final assesment of the Code First Girls Introduction to Python and Apps course. This code reads data from a CSV file containing monthly sales data, and then performs various calculations on the data to provide insights into the sales performance. It calculates the total sales across all months, the average sales, the month with the highest sales, the month with the lowest sales, and the monthly changes as a percentage.

**Skills:** Data reading and manipulation, data analysis, statistical analysis, rounding and formatting output.

**Technology:** Python, CSV file format.

**Results:** The code provides valuable insights into the sales performance, allowing stakeholders to make informed decisions based on the data. It calculates the total sales, average sales, and identifies the months with the highest and lowest sales. Additionally, it provides the monthly changes as a percentage, which can be used to identify trends and patterns in the sales data. The output is rounded and formatted in a clear and concise manner, making it easy to understand and interpret.


## Tableau 

### [Penn State DataFest 2021](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17d4qNMA1fWdwak2E3hV8WgiuTk2t6Yia/view?usp=sharing)

**Description:** Entry for a competition held at Penn State in 2021, where each group is given a task and a data set to work with. My group recieved data on the Opiod Epidemic in Germany, and were required to create data visualizations and a predictive model for risk levels.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization, statistical modelling

**Technology:** Tableau, R

**Results:** Constructing a Risk Profile for Drug Abuse in Germany

## MCM/ICM Mathematical Modelling Competition

### [Modelling the Spread of Vespa Mandarinia in Washington State](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HdtqhLlWoN8vA84FmMvP5cbHdl562g3R/view?usp=sharing)

**Description:** Completed as an entry for the 2021 Mathematical Modelling Competition, this project proposes a model that prioritizes resources to sites of new encounters with the Asian Giant Hornet using environmental variables as predictors of spread and colonization. The model utilizes GIS mapping systems and existing monitoring infrastructure to identify potential spread outward and determine areas most likely to host the hornets in the future, enabling local authorities to act quickly to quell the invasion before the hornets become established.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization, statistical modelling

**Technology:** Tableau, R
